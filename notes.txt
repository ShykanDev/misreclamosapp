// ⚠️ Important
// Ion Tabs and Ion Menu are not directly compatible.
// To make them work together, we need a different structure:
// The Ion Menu should exist as a single, top-level parent.
// All other tab views must be rendered separately (outside the menu’s parent).
// This ensures proper routing, transitions, and lifecycle behavior.
